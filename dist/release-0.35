Subject: Sybase module 0.35 released

WHAT IS IT:

The Sybase module provides a Python interface to the Sybase relational
database system.  It supports all of the Python Database API, version
2.0 with extensions.

NOTES:

In this release the module uses callback instead of inline error
handling from the Sybase CT library.  This has caused quite extensive
changes to the threading support inside the low level extension
module.

One of the nice side effects of using callback error handling is that
server errors while executing stored procedures will now be reported
correctly.

FreeTDS support is much improved in this version.

You can build for FreeTDS like this:

     python setup.py build_ext -D HAVE_FREETDS -U WANT_BULKCOPY
     python setup.py install

CHANGES SINCE 0.35pre3:

minimal.
