----------------------------------------

Edit setup.py:

- Change sybase to point to the top level directory when Sybase is
  installed on your system

- If necessary change the 'sybtcl' in syb_libs to 'tcl'.  The current
  value should be OK for Linux.

- Change mxdatetime_incdir to point to the location of mxDateTime.h
  from the mxDateTime source.  mxDateTime can be obtained from:

	http://www.lemburg.com/files/python/mxDateTime.html

Then all you should need to do is run the following command as root:

# python setup.py install
